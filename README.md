# 2018-Projects
These codes and projects are some practices that I wrote/re-wrote in Python.

There are classic algorithm practices in Data Structure, BSF/DSF, Dynamic Programming, etc. 

There are also trending topics like Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, etc. 

Some are for my own interests in Computer Science, some are for **other** usage which involves Computer Vision etc.
